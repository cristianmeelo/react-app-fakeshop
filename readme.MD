## üî® Project features

FakeShop is an online e-commerce. For the design, the semantic UI framework was used, providing more time for the development of state management. Using axios, accessing the page of each product makes the API call easy to read. Using redux in the app, we fixed the concepts before bringing them to the company's projects.
